We are **United Paradigms (UP)**. We make incredible experiences for *Minecraft*.

# Endeavor
**UP**'s core goal is to make the highest quality content for *Minecraft*, including add-ons, worlds, skin packs, and more.

To support this endeavor and to attempt to raise the *Minecraft* development space, **UP** also publicizes an array of tooling and documentation for the community. Unlike other contributors to the *Minecraft* space, our tooling and documentation will never be abandoned. We both want *and* need these to exist for ourselves and are happy to give to the broader community.

# Members
We're starting with a small team of 3 (hence the triquetra) close friends. We have over a combined decade of *Minecraft* engineering, art, and conceptualization amongst us.

- **Christopher Cook** is the owner and lead developer.
- **Sumiko Yanagi** is the lead artist and media director.
- **Marcus Acevedo** is the builder and main conceptualizer.
